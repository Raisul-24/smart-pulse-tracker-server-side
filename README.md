# b8a12-server-side-Raisul-24
This Node.js application is designed for a fitness tracking platform, integrating features like user management, trainer applications, forum posts, and subscription services. It employs MongoDB for database storage and utilizes various APIs for functionalities such as user authentication, payment processing (Stripe), and JWT token generation.
Database design:
1. Express Server: Handles HTTP requests, implements middleware for CORS, JSON parsing, and authentication verification.
2. MongoDB: Utilizes a MongoDB database to store user details, features, trainers, applied trainers, bookings, subscribers, forum posts, and payment information.
3. JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication: Verifies user identity through JWT tokens, providing access to protected routes.
4. Stripe API: Integrates the Stripe API for handling payment transactions and creating payment intents.

Database Design:
1. Users Collection: Stores user information, including roles (admin, trainer, general user), accessible via `/users` endpoints.
2. Features Collection: Contains fitness-related features accessible via `/features`.
3. Trainers Collection: Holds details of fitness trainers available for booking, accessed through `/trainers`.
4. Applied Trainers Collection: Manages applications from trainers applying for roles, processed via `/applyTrainers`.
5. Bookings Collection: Stores information about user-trainer bookings via `/bookings`.
6. Subscribers Collection: Records user subscriptions, managed through `/subscribers`.
7. Forum Collection: Stores forum posts accessible via `/forum`.
8. Payments Collection: Manages payment information and transaction history, accessed via `/payments`.

Server-Side Logic:
1. JWT Middleware: Verifies the authenticity of JWT tokens to secure routes.
2. Admin and Trainer Verification Middleware: Ensures that only authorized admin and trainer roles access specific routes.
3. Stripe Payment Intent Creation: Generates payment intents through the `/create-payment-intent` route, integrated with the Stripe API.
4. User Operations: Includes CRUD operations for users, role updates, and specific user data retrieval.
5. Trainer Operations: Manages trainer-related operations, applications, confirmations, and role updates.
6. Forum Operations: Supports forum post retrieval, voting, and analytics.
7. Subscription Operations: Handles subscriber information storage and retrieval.
8. Payment Operations: Manages payment information storage, retrieval, and client-secret generation for Stripe transactions.
9. Admin Analytics: Provides statistics on the number of users, subscribers, and forum posts via `/admin-stats`.

###
This application demonstrates a robust server-side structure for a fitness tracking platform, incorporating user authentication, role-based access control, payment processing, and various fitness-related features.
